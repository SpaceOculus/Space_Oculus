    <p>Have you ever wondered....?
        We Humans increases our growth by ingesting food but on the other hands in order for galaxy to become larger they have to ingest a whole another galaxy(should be comparatively of lesser size than eater).....REALLY That's true
        Our Milky way galaxy is formed when a large sized galaxy ingested a smaller one.
        Even Astronomer tells that after many years(approx 4 billion years later) ANDROMADA galaxy will attract MILKY WAY towards itself which will cause collision between them resulting in ingestion of our Mily way galaxy.</p>
