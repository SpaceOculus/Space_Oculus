    <h1>White holes</h1>
    <p>In general relativity, a white hole is a hypothetical region of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime"
        target="_blank">spacetime</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_singularity" target="_blank">Gravitational singularity</a> that cannot be entered
        from the outside, although energy-matter, light and information can escape from it. In this sense, it is the
        reverse of a black hole, which can be entered only from the outside and from which energy-matter, light and
        information cannot escape. White holes appear in the theory of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wormhole" target="_blank"> eternal black holes</a>. In addition to a black hole
        region in the future, such a solution of the Einstein field equations has a white hole region in its past.This
        region does not exist for black holes that have formed through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_collapse" target="_blank"> Gravitational collapse</a>, however, nor are there
        any observed physical processes through which a white hole could be formed.
        Supermassive black holes (SBHs) are theoretically predicted to be at the center of every galaxy and that
        possibly, a galaxy cannot form without one. Stephen Hawking and others have proposed that these SBHs spawn a
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermassive_black_hole" target="_blank">Supermassive black hole</a>/Big Bang.</p>
