    <h1>Stars</h1>
                <p>A star is an astronomical object consisting of a luminous spheroid of <a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_(physics)" target="_blank">plasma</a> held together
                    by its own
                    gravity. The nearest star to Earth is the Sun. Many other stars are visible to the naked eye at
                    night, but due to their immense distance from Earth they appear as fixed points of light in the sky.
                    The most prominent stars are grouped into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation"
                        target="_balnk">constellations</a> and <a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterism_(astronomy)" target="_blank">asterisms</a> , and
                    many of the brightest
                    stars have proper names.The observable universe contains an estimated 1022 to 1024 stars, but most
                    are invisible to the naked eye from Earth, including all individual stars outside our galaxy, the
                    Milky Way.</p>
