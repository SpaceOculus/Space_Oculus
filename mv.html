    <p>Astronomers studying the vast reaches of the milky Way Galaxy have discovered a gigantic cavity in space, a
        sphere-shaped void located in the sky among the constellations Perseus and Taurus which literally has nothing in
        it not even light.The cavity spans nearly 1.8 billion light-years and was likely formed by an ancient supernova
        that went off some 10 million years ago.
        Actually interesting fact is that doesn't matter what is the size of supernova it can never create such a huge
        area of void.Another rumours are also there which tells that this is the doing of an advanced aliens
        civilization....,they had created a device which is called DYSON SPHERE which has the ability to drew out all
        the energy of stars which are present in universe for doing another work and this VOID is an example of this
        Dyson sphere</p>
