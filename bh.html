    <h1>Black holes</h1>
                
                <p>
                    A black hole is a region of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime"
                        target="_blank">spacetime</a> where gravity is so strong that no particles or even
                    electromagnetic radiation such as light can escape from it.Although it has an enormous effect on the
                    fate and circumstances of an object crossing it, according to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity">general relativity</a> it has no locally
                    detectable features.In many ways, a black hole acts like an ideal black body, as it reflects no
                    light.Moreover, quantum field theory in curved spacetime predicts that event horizons emit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawking_radiation" target="_blank">Hawking radiation</a>, with the same spectrum as a black body of a temperature inversely proportional to its
                    mass. This temperature is on the order of billionths of a kelvin for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_black_hole" target="_blank">Stellar black hole</a>,
                    making it essentially impossible to observe directly.
